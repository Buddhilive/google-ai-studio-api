# Introduction

This project is a pre-built API project using NestJS, a popular JavaScript framework. It acts as a jumpstart for developers who want to use Google's powerful Gemini AI in their applications. By using this template, developers can avoid setting everything up from scratch and quickly integrate Gemini's functionalities like text generation or chatbots into their own apps. It's essentially a launchpad to get you going with Gemini AI development!
